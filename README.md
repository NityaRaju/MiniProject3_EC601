Using data from a Portuguese Bankâ€™s telemarketing campaign which sold Term-Deposits, multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented in order to classify whether or not a given customer would subscribe to a term deposit. The benefits of such a classification include better targeted marketing campaigns and therefore cost reductions as well minimal negative externalities to those that would not like to subscribe to a term deposit. Through data cleaning, feature selection and feature engineering the dataset is developed and run through the algorithms(Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, K-nn and Logistic regression. We conclude that Naive Bayes works best at this classification task when measured on Accuracy scores,F-scores and Run-times.


The dataset is quite large to load. Here is the link for it:
