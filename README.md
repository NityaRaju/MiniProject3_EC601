Using data from a Portuguese Bankâ€™s telemarketing campaign which sold Term-Deposits, multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented in order to classify whether or not a given customer would subscribe to a term deposit. The benefits of such a classification include better targeted marketing campaigns and therefore cost reductions as well minimal negative externalities to those that would not like to subscribe to a term deposit. Through data cleaning, feature selection and feature engineering the dataset is developed and run through the algorithms(Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes.) We conclude that Naive Bayes works best at this classification task when measured on Accuracy scores,F-scores and Run-times.

The dataset is quite large to load. Here is the link for it:

The customers in the training data set were classified based on whether or not they subscribed to a term deposit at the
end of the phone call - either a yes tag or no tag. The features of each customer included a number of
social (marital status, education), economic (job, consumer price index) and personal (age)
details. The training data set contained 20 different customer attributes/features plus the
classification of whether or not they signed up for the term deposit. The dataset was subject
to several machine learning techniques to build a data-driven prediction model to predict
the success of bank telemarketing.
